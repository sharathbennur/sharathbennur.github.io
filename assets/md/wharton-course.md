### Wharton course details

I teach a course to Wharton MBA and upper-level undergraduate students on the theory and practical applications of text analytics, natural language processing (NLP), and large language models (LLMs) in various industries ([STAT 4240/7240](https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/202230/STAT7240002/)). The course provides a comprehensive overview of text analytics and NLP, starting from the basics and ending with LLMs and multi-modal models. The course covers enough theory that students gain an intuition for how the models work and what they are learning. However, unlike a CS / NLP class, there is an emphasis on how these techniques and models are applied in different industries.

The course's primary objective is to enable non-specialists from other fields to understand how these models work and apply these techniques to their own data to obtain interesting insights. The lectures are complemented with `Python` code in `Jupyter Notebooks`, which help students climb the steep learning curve, especially for non-specialists. The syllabus and links to the coursework are listed below.
