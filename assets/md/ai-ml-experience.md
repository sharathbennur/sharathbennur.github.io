I am very passionate about improving outcomes through technology, data and data science. I bring with me a wealth of experience in AI-ML from ideation to implementation, ML-Ops and generative AI. In past roles, I have worked on and led teams working on AI-ML algorithms that required both supervised and unsupervised machine learning. This includes recommendation engines, classification, optimization, regression, natural language processing and complex ensemble models like Next Best action / customer / etc.

My work typically involves working cross-functionally with business stakeholders, product and engineering teams to help ideate and prioritize data science projects across global organizations. I also bring expertise in [decision intelligence]({% post_url 2021-09-08-decision-intelligence %}) - which combines fields such as AI-ML, and behavioral sciences, to support improved decision-making.

The work has spanned analytics, statistical analysis, traditional machine learning, deep learning, and most recently tuning and running LLMs. The choice between the different options listed in the previous sentence have often been determined based on the context, complexity of the data and resources available vs. pre-determined.

I currently teach an application oriented [course on Text Analytics & Natural Language Processing (NLP)](/assets/md/wharton-course) at the Wharton School at UPenn. The course emphasizes real world NLP applications; starting from the foundational NLP concepts to cutting edge concepts like fine-tuning and RAG + LLM based agents. This also covers how modern deep learning technologies and LLMs are being fine-tuned, risks & safeguards around LLMs and future opportunities for innovation.

When it comes to data, my learnings have been specific and contextual and I'm by no means an expert. This includes intermediate data modeling for SQL and no-SQL databases, and most types of cloud data storage.
