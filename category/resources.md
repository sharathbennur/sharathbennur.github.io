## Keeping up

In the past, I've been asked for recommendations on how to keep up with the ever changing landscape of AI-ML, LLMs, Generative AI, etc. So, here are some resources I use stay updated no particular order:

* [The Data Exchange](https://thedataexchange.media/author/bglorica/) podcast by Ben Lorica is excellent.  The breadth and depth of his guests make it an irreplaceable source for keeping up with AI-ML research.

* [Ahead of AI by Sebastian Raschka](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/) - writes on Substack on the latest in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research. I especially appreciate his ability to cut through the volume of published research and surface advancements.

* [MLOps newsletter]

## Tools

Here are some tools from the AI-ML space that I've used in the past that I find useful and relevant.

#### Model Gardens

* [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) - open model repository, host a mind-boggling variety of trained deep learning models across use cases.
* [FastAPI]()
* [Ray]()
* [Streamlit]()
* [SciKit-Learn]()

#### NLP specific

* [LangChain]()
* [SpaCy]()
* [Gensim]()
* [NLTK]()
* 

### AI-ML tutorials

Various tutorials I've bookmarked over the years:

* [Keras.io tutorials](https://keras.io/examples/) - Keras and TensorFlow specific but a great resource for learning how to use the Keras API
* [Hugging Face]
