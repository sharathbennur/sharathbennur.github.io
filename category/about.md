The constant worrying about writing grants and publishing papers combined with a disinterest in doing anything innovative was crushing my wish to have an impact. 

That led to a move to data science - which was just beginning to take off as an alternate profession for ex-acadmics like me. I was fortunate to get into a academia-to-industry bootcamp called [Insights Data Science](https://insightfellows.com/data-science). It was one of the formative experiences of my professional life - the 12 week program not only helped fill the many gaps in my understanding of data science by learning from and interacting with my peers and experts in the field that were invited to speak, but also gave me my first indirect taste of entrepreneurship.

After Insights, I spent a couple of years at [Gartner](), working as an entry level Business Associate across a couple of their BUs. It was a really interesting experience. Not only was it my first exposure to how large businesses worked, it was also the first I saw how the sausage was made. The behind the scenes politics,
