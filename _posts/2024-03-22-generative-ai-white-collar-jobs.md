There are two primary viewpoints regarding generative AI and white-collar jobs. 
* The first is that job losses are unavoidable
* The second is that generative AI will help white-collar workers be more productive and that the job losses are being exaggerated.

So which one is it?

### Some examples

The truth is likely somewhere in between and much more nuanced than what the headlines suggest. Generative AI will probably result in some job losses or even prevent some types of jobs from being created in the future, but let's start by examining some examples from various sectors.

#### Software coding jobs

When Github announced CoPilot - a generative AI coding assistant - there was a lot of hype around [increases in productivity of developers](https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/) who used Github CoPilot. As seen in the image below, both productivity and general happiness or satisfaction increased in developers using copilot vs those who didnt.

However, there are some caveats with this white paper, e.g. a small sample size and what about the inherent conflict of interest. That said, this still offers some intruiging opportunities for greater productivity. In my personal experience from using ChatGPT - I've had mixed results. For simple tasks - it tends to be fantastic - the clear and comprehensive code along with its rationale are very helpful.

But this helpfulness really breaks down when it comes to more complicated code or obscure packages or languages. I'm sure this will improve over time, but I'm not really sure how the cost will scale over time. 

Which brings us to creativity and problem solving - two essential characteristics that human developers can bring to bear, which generative models intrinsically cannot deal with as you cannot train a LLM on something it hasn't seen before. There are some hints that reinforcement learning may pave the way forward to provide creative solutions to difficult problems, but as of now - it's unclear how this will work, and how much it will cost (we'll talk about this more later).

Lastly, what about other measures of software development? This [study from GitClear](https://www.gitclear.com/coding_on_copilot_data_shows_ais_downward_pressure_on_code_quality) suggests that while developer satisfaction and productivity may increase in the short term, it might not last as a lot of the code produced may revised or reverted.

> Code churn -- the percentage of lines that are reverted or updated less than two weeks after being authored -- is projected to double in 2024 compared to its 2021, pre-AI baseline. We further find that the percentage of "added code" and "copy/pasted code" is increasing in proportion to “updated,” “deleted,” and “moved” code. In this regard, code generated during 2023 more resembles an itinerant contributor, prone to violate the DRY-ness of the repos visited.

As software development was the first sector for which generative-AI was used extensively for improving productivity - its likely where we'll see the earliest impacts - both in terms of pitfalls and potential. So stay tuned! 

#### Architecture jobs

Per [this provocative article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-03-12/this-ai-architect-will-design-your-climate-friendly-dream-home) in Bloomberg Businessweek - architecture jobs - at least the ones that involve boring tasks like drafting, preparing proposals, permit applications, etc may well be fully outsourced to generative-AI.

It is likely that a lot of architects, especially senior architects will appreciate having generative-AI applications take away some of the mundane tasks of their jobs. This again puts internships or junior roles at risk, rather that imperil all architect roles.

#### In Legal

The legal industry is known to be very conservative when it comes to adopting new technology. However, big law firms are now starting to explore Generative AI - not necessarily to embrace innovation, but to protect themselves from competitors - as can be seen from the job postings for AI roles [recently](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/big-laws-ai-jobs-lay-foundation-for-techs-wider-use-at-firms).

> Firms are focusing on practical applications, from using AI to help lawyers do research and draft briefs to streamlining marketing and business development functions.

> “We realized this was incredibly disruptive tech early,” said Wakeling, whose firm in February announced that it is integrating “Harvey,” an AI platform that’s been enhanced for legal work. “Law is words, and we have a new way of mastering words.”

#### In life sciences



### What about cost?

At what point does it become cheaper or better to just go back to using people. After all, we are seeing something exactly like this with near-shoring and re-shoring of manufacturing jobs in the US in response to shortages during the pandemic and the security implications of being reliant on rivals.

If I had to look into my crystal ball, I would guess that like with off-shoring of manufacturing, we'll see the pendulum swing too far and then swing backwards towards using more people for jobs that could be done by generative-AI.
