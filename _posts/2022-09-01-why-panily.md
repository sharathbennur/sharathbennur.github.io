Panily was created based on personal experiences. I was diagnosed with [Gout](https://www.arthritis.org/diseases/gout) just as the pandemic was winding down. I have two vivid memories from that time period that inspired me to create Panily - a HealthTech app for patients facing healthcare issues like me.

The first memory was when I went to the podiatrist with a foot issue, and I couldn't remember which foot had been afflicted a couple of months back - was it my right foot or left? The second memory was when I visited my primary care physician (PCP) and realized that I remembered very few details from my podiatrist visit.

Both experiences were deeply unsettling! During those months of the pandemic, getting gout and not being able to get a diagnosis or treatment was very stressful and painful. But equally painful and embarrassing was not being able to remember the details of my health conditions. Panily was created to solve a problem: where should your healthcare data go when healthcare events happen outside of clinical settings.

During my user research, I noticed that patients and their caregivers were using whatever means were available to keep track of healthcare data such as notebooks, printouts, or Excel files with detailed notes. 

### What Panily was trying to solve

Panily's solution to this problem was to enable saving all your healthcare data to a secure, private, encrypted database on your smartphone through the Panily mobile apps. The vision for Panily was to give patients and their caregivers digital health tools to record and share health events outside of clinical settings.

Panily's features included:
- The ability to save different types of healthcare events, including visits, reminders etc.
- Track conditions and allergies, combined with tracking symptoms associated with each condition or allergy and view historical data
- Improve medication adherence by keeping track of prescriptions and medications, and get reminders to both take medications and refill them
- A focus on privacy - through an encrypted secure on-device database, no data was moved to the cloud without a user's consent

Some additional features that were planned for but never fully built out included:
- Full bi-directional EHR integration to push / pull healthcare data
- Secure sharing of healthcare data with family members

I plan to follow this post up sometime with a longer post on what went right and what went wrong with Panily, stay tuned or email me if you're interested in finding out more.
