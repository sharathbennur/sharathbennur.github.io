I've been experimenting with language models (LMs) for a few years now, everything from running small models on CoLab to using different APIs from Cohere and OpenAI to try different LMs and their capabilities. A big takeaway from these experiments has been cost and applicability:
* Using language models at scale from any of the providers is expensive. 
* No matter what business you are in - eventually the business will ask about ROI.

So this is a series of posts on using whatever tools are available to fine-tune and host LMs like Llama2, and combine them with techniques like RAG, function calling or knowledge graphs.
