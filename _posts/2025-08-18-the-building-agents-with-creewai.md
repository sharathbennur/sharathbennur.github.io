## What was the goal?

### What agents did I use?

### What were the tasks?

## What the agents wrote:

At the end of this 2 day experiment with crewai, here are some of my learnings:
- Building agents is becoming remarkably easy, however workflow, state and memory management do not seem trivial.
- To see / run the code (you will need to copy the Jupyter notebook and provide your own Openrouter / OpenAI API key) I used to create the article, see this link:

### Positives:

1. I was surprised by how accessible the entire stack is, from creating the planner agent to connecting the agents together. All this took a couple of days to put together.
2. I was also surprised by how detailed the content writing plan ended up being - though I am not sure if that was because I was using GPT-5-mini or I would have seen similar results with another LLM. Definitely worth testing further.
3. I learnt something new! Even though I am quite familar with different exhause systems on the market for ND Miatas, I didn't realize that some of them created challenges with heat sheilding. I had to double-check what the agents said - turns out they were right!
4. The task instructions definitely need more detail on tone and whether to include promotional material or not or the article can sound sales-ey.
5. All this cost a grand total of 3.5c, this of course excludes the time I spent putting it all together.

### Negatives:

1. Despite the editor agent, I think the article needs proofing and validation.
2. It sounds boring! There are more and more AI-written articles being published and quite frankly - they are relatively easy to detect as they are often boring to read. I'm sure the agents or the prompts we use will eventually overcome this, but for now - its still an issue.
