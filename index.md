## **Hi, I'm Sharath!**

Experienced AI-ML leader with deep expertise in all phases of AI-ML, from ideation to  building and integration of AI-ML algorithms into products. Passionate about collaborating with partners and working cross-functionally, to optimize decision-making strategies based on data, analytics and data science. I'm very excited by the potential of AI-ML, not just in healthcare & life sciences, but across industries to unlock greater efficiences and new discoveries.
