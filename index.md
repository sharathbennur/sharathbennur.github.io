##### Summary

Sharath Bennur is an an experienced AI-ML leader with extensive experience in the integration and end-to-end deployment of AI-ML algorithms into products in production. In previous roles, he has worked hand-in-hand with stakeholders, product and engineering teams to help ideate, develop and deploy AI-ML algorithms that can both deliver value and scale.

##### AI-ML

This has typically involved working with a variety of business and operations teams, spending time to understand the processes, data and analytics that go into critical decisions made.

##### Technology experience



##### Focus on Healthcare
A focus and passion throughout my career has been on optimizing decision-making strategies based on data, analytics and data science. I also have experience building and leading teams of data scientists and engineers, while working hand-in-hand with stakeholders, product leaders and clients in order to solve complex business problems and have measurable impact on business outcomes. A focus and passion throughout my career has involved working with a variety of stakeholders and partners to understand current processes and decision-making in order to build focused AI/ML solutions that are used by the business and have measurable impact.

##### Experience in Life Sciences

In my previous roles, I was responsible for the development, implementation and integration of end-to-end machine learning algorithms, from working with stakeholders across products, to building a team that builds the algorithms, to evangelizing MLOps principles and working with our platforms team to build end-to-end pipelines that can be deployed at scale. These roles involved understanding the needs of the organization and translating them into data science projects, while balancing different priorities and team capacity.

Some key learnings include - being agnostic about whether the chosen solution was analytical, predictive or required AI/ML & integration with UI/UX is key for creating impactful solutions. As my team worked with multiple product teams, business leaders and clients, my role involved balancing priorities, communicating concepts and value of our solutions to non-technical audiences. My work in Iqvia, on both the commercial and research / clinical sides required me to work with business and operations partners to understand the processes, data and workflows involved in their day-to-day, to strategize where analytical, predictive or other AI/ML algorithms can be applied most effectively. A key learning was to be agnostic to whether the solution was analytical, predictive or required AI/ML, what mattered more was to create integrated impactful solutions. As my team worked with multiple product teams, business leaders and clients across Iqvia’s technology solutions BU using agile methodologies, my role involved balancing priorities, communicating concepts and value of our solutions to non-technical audiences.


I am also very passionate about improving healthcare outcomes through technology, data and data science in the patient space. my experience with patient healthcare journeys along with a deep knowledge of the healthcare data (EHR, claims) and machine learning space.

In my previous roles at Iqvia, I helped develop and manage end-to-end machine learning algorithms, from working with stakeholders across products, to building a team that builds the algorithms, to evangelizing MLOps principles and working with our platforms team to build end-to-end pipelines that can be deployed at scale.

My experiences in Iqvia across our technology portfolio (marketing, sales, content management, territory design, etc) gives me a broad background on the “Market” side of the life sciences industry. My work on Decision Intelligence on the clinical side helped me further refine strategies on how decision-making in large complex organizations can be optimized using analytics and data science. My final year at Iqvia was spent on building a Decision Intelligence strategy. Decision Intelligence enables the conversion of analytics and data science into actionable insights and products. At Iqvia, I initially worked across our technology portfolio with our business and product partners to help build algorithms like Next Best Customer, Territory design, etc. My final year at Iqvia was spent on building a Decision Intelligence strategy - Decision Intelligence enables the conversion of analytics and data science into actionable insights, features and products. I worked with our clinical Therapeutic Strategy leads and other partners to understand the processes, data and analytics used for making decisions around site selection and patient enrollment. These insights were then used to make pointed recommendations to our AI/ML and product teams.


I also teach an application oriented course on Natural Language Processing (NLP) at the Wharton School at UPenn. The course emphasizes real world NLP applications; starting from the foundational NLP concepts to cutting edge concepts like fine-tuning and RAG + LLM based agents. This also covers how modern deep learning technologies and LLMs are being fine-tuned, risks & safeguards around LLMs and future opportunities for innovation.
