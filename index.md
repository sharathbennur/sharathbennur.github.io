## **Hi, I'm Sharath**

Experienced AI-ML leader with deep expertise in all phases of AI-ML, from ideation to  building and integration of AI-ML algorithms into products. Passionate about collaborating with partners and working cross-functionally, to optimize decision-making strategies based on data, analytics and data science. I'm very excited by the potential of AI-ML, not just in healthcare & life sciences, but across industries to unlock greater efficiences and new discoveries.

My personal philosophy and details about my experience are below:

- Recently exited Panily ([see archived site](/assets/panily.com/index.html)) - where I created iOS and Android apps that was based on personal experiences; to give patients and their caregivers tools to record and track their healthcare experiences outside of clinical settings. ([details](tags.html#panily))
- I teach a text analytics course (STATS 7240) at [the Wharton School](https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/202230/STAT7240002/) at the University of Pennsylvannia. ([see more](/assets/md/wharton-course))
- I have extensive experience with building AI-ML algorithms, from working with stakeholders and partners to understand the problem, to ideating data requirements and AI-ML algorithm design, to working with product and engineering teams to ensure measurable product integration in production ([read more]()).  
- I spearheaded [Iqvia's](https://www.iqvia.com/) foray into decision intelligence and it influences how I think about the value of AI-ML vs other forms of decision support ([read more]({% post_url 2021-09-08-decision-intelligence %})). ([read white paper](assets/pdf/decision-intelligence.pdf))
- Also experienced in MLOps - started working on MLOps just as it was getting started ([details]({% post_url 2021-03-15-mlops %}))
