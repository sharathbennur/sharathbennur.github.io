### What went wrong

In a nutshell - naivete. Panily was built on the assumption that people valued being able to collect and organize their own healthcare data, that this could be habit forming and something people actually wanted to do.

The reality was that most users (or potential users) had no interest in taking the time to collate and organize their healthcare data, no matter what the rationale or necessity.
