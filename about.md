This personal website is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the original [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) and [Hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout/) and published to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). These allow for the generation of a static website using a combination of html, markdown and ruby gems.

More detailed post on the tutorial to build this is [here]().

#### More info

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From [the project's readme](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

  > Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

[Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) is a Jekyll theme which provides a fully furnished Jekyll setup and is fairly opinionated about website layout, design and tools.

  > Hyde is a brazen two-column Jekyll theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on Poole, the Jekyll butler.

[Hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) updates Hyde for Jekyll 3.x and 4.x while adding some new functionality. It's also the first repo that worked out of the box for me while I was playing around with this.

  > In keeping with the original Hyde theme, Hydeout aims to keep the overall design lightweight and plugin-free. JavaScript is currently limited only to Disqus and Google Analytics (and is only loaded if you provide configuration variables).
